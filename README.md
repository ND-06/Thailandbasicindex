# Thailand Basic Index

This exercise has been made during The Hacking Project Bootcamp, by myself and the support of my team (THP-Nice) and in order to pratice front dev with CSS3, HTML5 and JS. 
This training is a mini webguide for Thailand Lovers.
You can notice a Navbar with logo and avatar, but also stylized tabs with some stylized cards and buttons.
This website is under construction, so keep in touch to see the evolution !
